# Independent Task 4

I was inspired by Streamlit's Uber Demo to use a time slider to visualize bar graphs on a map. I looked at college enrollment at seven New Jersey Colleges( Rowan University, Rutgers- New Brunswick, -Camden, and -Newark, Montclair State, TCNJ, and Stockton University) and how it's grown from 1996 to 2019. Users can select what year they'd like to analyze. 

You can find the data I used [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eUUt9c7IZt9UmryY7oTZ_yah_LSNxpyrDDLrHD7OwDg/edit?usp=sharing ). 
You can find Streamlit's Uber example [here](https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups/main), some additional code that I looked at [here](https://deck.gl/docs/api-reference/layers/column-layer ), and really helpful documentation [here](https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/column_layer.html).
